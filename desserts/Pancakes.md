Chocolate Pancakes
Servings: 8–10 medium pancakes
Time: 20 minutes
🧈 Ingredients:
1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour
¼ cup (25 g) unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tbsp sugar (or more to taste)
2 tsp baking powder
¼ tsp salt
1 large egg
¾ cup (180 ml) milk (dairy or non-dairy)
2 tbsp melted butter (or oil)
½ tsp vanilla extract
¼ cup (45 g) chocolate chips (optional but amazing)
## Instructions:
Mix dry ingredients:
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
Mix wet ingredients:
In another bowl, whisk the egg, milk, melted butter, and vanilla until smooth.
Combine:
Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir gently until just combined — a few lumps are okay!
(Optional: fold in chocolate chips.)
Cook:
Heat a lightly greased skillet or griddle over medium heat.
Pour ¼ cup of batter for each pancake.
Cook until bubbles form on the surface (about 2 minutes), then flip and cook another minute until set.
Serve:
Stack them up and serve warm with:
Maple syrup or chocolate sauce
Fresh berries or sliced bananas
Whipped cream or ice cream (for dessert style!)
