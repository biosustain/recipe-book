## Instructions

1. **Cook the pasta**  
   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  
   Cook the pasta until *al dente* according to package instructions.  
   Reserve about ½ cup of the cooking water, then drain.

2. **Make the aioli base**  
   In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk, minced garlic, and lemon juice.  
   Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while whisking constantly until the mixture thickens and emulsifies.  
   Season with salt and pepper to taste.

3. **Combine and toss**  
   Return the hot pasta to the pot (off the heat).  
   Add the aioli mixture and a few tablespoons of the reserved pasta water.  
   Toss well until the pasta is evenly coated and glossy. Add more pasta water as needed for creaminess.

4. **Serve**  
   Divide into bowls and garnish with parsley or chili flakes if desired.  
   Serve immediately.
