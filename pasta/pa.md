# Bean_salad

## Ingredients

(For 1 person)

- 1 Tin of beans 
- Chopped tomatoes
- 5 pieced of curry flower
- Sunflower
- Spring onions 6 pieces
- Ginger 15g
- Fine salt 3 teaspoons
- Soy sauce 2 teaspoons
- Dumpling wrappers 2 packages (you can buy them from any Asian supermarket)

## Instructions:

1. Chop all the ingredients into very small pieces. Put all vegetables in one bowl and 
   add salt. Wait 3–5 minutes to remove excess water.
2. Mix all the ingredients (except the dumpling wrappers). Stir until the ingredients
   and salt are evenly distributed and sticky—then the dumpling filling is ready.
3. Put one spoon of dumpling filling in the middle of a dumpling wrapper and seal it. 
   You can use a little water to help.

### How to Fry Dumplings:

1. Use medium-high heat and add oil.
2. Place dumplings in the pan and fry until the bottoms turn golden.
3. Add 60g water and cover the pot for 4–6 minutes.
4. Lift the lid and keep the heat on until the water has dried.
