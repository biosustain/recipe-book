# Potato Salad Recipe

## Ingredients

- 2 lbs potatoes (Yukon Gold or red potatoes work well)  
- 3 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and chopped  
- 1/2 cup celery, finely diced  
- 1/4 cup red onion, finely diced  
- 1/3 cup dill pickles, chopped  
- 3/4 cup mayonnaise
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar  
- 1 teaspoon sugar  
- Salt and pepper to taste  
- Paprika (optional, for garnish)  
- Fresh dill or parsley (optional, for garnish)  

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Potatoes:**  
   - Wash the potatoes thoroughly and cut them into bite-sized cubes (about 3/4 inch).  
   - Place the potato cubes in a large pot and cover with cold salted water.  
   - Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10–15 minutes until tender but still firm when pierced with a fork.  
   - Drain the potatoes and let them cool to room temperature.  

2. **Prepare the Other Ingredients:**  
   - While the potatoes are cooling, hard-boil the eggs, then peel and chop them.  
   - Finely dice the celery and red onion.  
   - Chop the dill pickles.  

3. **Make the Dressing:**  
   - In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, and sugar until smooth.  
   - Season with salt and pepper to taste.  

4. **Combine Everything:**  
   - In a large bowl, gently combine the cooled potatoes, chopped eggs, celery, red onion, and pickles.  
   - Pour the dressing over the potato mixture and gently fold everything together until evenly coated.  

5. **Garnish (Optional):**  
   - If you're using paprika, sprinkle it on top for color and a subtle smoky flavor.  
   - Add fresh dill or parsley for extra freshness and visual appeal.  

6. **Serve:**  
   - Enjoy the potato salad immediately, or cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving to allow the flavors to meld together for an even better taste.
